# Hello!
Hi, this is my project github directory for my physical and tangible hci class. To view more about this project please visit: https://jaedwin.github.io/HCI/dnd.html

# Instructions
+ The music file `purrple-cat-flourish` was too big, the original version can be found here: https://www.free-stock-music.com/purrple-cat-flourish.html
+ On Windows, open cmd and cd into the source directory, then run: `python listen.py`
+ If you run into issues with listen.py, edit it and change `CAT4` to the correct port you're using
